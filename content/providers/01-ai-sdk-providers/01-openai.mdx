# OpenAI Provider

The [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) provider contains language model support for the OpenAI chat and completion APIs
and embedding model support for the OpenAI embeddings API.

## Setup

The OpenAI provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/openai` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="pnpm install @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `openai` from `@ai-sdk/openai`:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createOpenAI` from `@ai-sdk/openai` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const openai = createOpenAI({
  // custom settings, e.g.
  compatibility: 'strict', // strict mode, enable when using the OpenAI API
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the OpenAI provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being send using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **organization** _string_

  OpenAI Organization.

- **project** _string_

  OpenAI project.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **compatibility** _"strict" | "compatible"_

  OpenAI compatibility mode. Should be set to `strict` when using the OpenAI API,
  and `compatible` when using 3rd party providers. In `compatible` mode, newer
  information such as `streamOptions` are not being sent, resulting in `NaN`
  token usage. Defaults to 'compatible'.

## Language Models

The OpenAI provider instance is a function that you can invoke to create a language model:

```ts
const model = openai('gpt-4-turbo');
```

It automatically selects the correct API based on the model id.
You can also pass additional settings in the second argument:

```ts
const model = openai('gpt-4-turbo', {
  // additional settings
});
```

The available options depend on the API that's automatically chosen for the model (see below).
If you want to explicitly select a specific model API, you can use `.chat` or `.completion`.

### Example

You can use OpenAI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

OpenAI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, and `streamUI` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core) and [AI SDK RSC](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc)).

### Model Capabilities

| Model           | Image Input         | Object Generation   | Tool Usage          | Tool Streaming      |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `gpt-4o`        | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4-turbo`   | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4`         | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |

### Chat Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) using the `.chat()` factory method.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `gpt-4`.
The OpenAI chat models support tool calls and some have multi-modal capabilities.

```ts
const model = openai.chat('gpt-3.5-turbo');
```

OpenAI chat models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
const model = openai.chat('gpt-3.5-turbo', {
  logitBias: {
    // optional likelihood for specific tokens
    '50256': -100,
  },
  user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
});
```

The following optional settings are available for OpenAI chat models:

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the token from being generated.

- **logProbs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

### Completion Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) using the `.completion()` factory method.
The first argument is the model id.
Currently only `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` is supported.

```ts
const model = openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct');
```

OpenAI completion models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
const model = openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', {
  echo: true, // optional, echo the prompt in addition to the completion
  logitBias: {
    // optional likelihood for specific tokens
    '50256': -100,
  },
  suffix: 'some text', // optional suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
  user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
});
```

The following optional settings are available for OpenAI completion models:

- **echo**: _boolean_

  Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt;
  token from being generated.

- **logProbs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **suffix** _string_

  The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)
using the `.embedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large');
```

OpenAI embedding models support several aditional settings.
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
const model = openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large', {
  dimensions: 512 // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
  user: 'test-user' // optional unique user identifier
})
```

The following optional settings are available for OpenAI embedding models:

- **dimensions**: _number_

  Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.
