# Examples for Next.js Pages Router

The Vercel AI SDK is designed to work with Next.js Pages Router. The examples will demonstrate querying the language model and rendering the user interfaces using `ai/core` and `ai/react`, respectively.

## Next.js Compatibility

| Framework            | ai/rsc   | ai/core  | ai/react |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Next.js App Router   | <Check/> | <Check/> | <Check/> |
| Next.js Pages Router | <Cross/> | <Check/> | <Check/> |

> **Note:** The App Router fully supports React Server Components, enhancing your development experience when using `ai/rsc`. This integration makes it easier to manage building [Generative User Interfaces](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc) and improves [Server-Client State Management](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/generative-ui-state), offering a more streamlined development process.
