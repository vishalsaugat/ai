# Provider Management

<Note>Provider management is an experimental feature.</Note>

When you work with multiple providers and models, it is often desirable to manage them in a central place
and access the models through simple string ids.

The Vercel AI SDK provides a [`ProviderRegistry`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/provider-registry) for this purpose.
You can register multiple providers. The provider id will become the prefix of the model id:
`providerId:modelId`.

## Provider Registry

### Setup

You can create a registry with multiple providers and models using `experimental_createProviderRegistry`.

<Note>
  It is common to keep the registry setup in a separate file and import it where
  needed.
</Note>

```ts filename={"registry.ts"}
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_createProviderRegistry as createProviderRegistry } from 'ai';

export const registry = createProviderRegistry({
  // register provider with prefix and default setup:
  anthropic,

  // register provider with prefix and custom setup:
  openai: createOpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  }),
});
```

### Language models

You can access language models by using the `languageModel` method on the registry.
The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.

```ts highlight={"5"}
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { registry } from './registry';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: registry.languageModel('openai:gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```

### Text embedding models

You can access text embedding models by using the `textEmbeddingModel` method on the registry.
The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.

```ts highlight={"5"}
import { embed } from 'ai';
import { registry } from './registry';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: registry.textEmbeddingModel('openai:text-embedding-3-small'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```

## Model Maps

An alternative approach to the provider registry is to just create an object that maps ids
to models. This has the following advantages:

- You can restrict the models that you want to use (e.g. when you let your users choose models)
- You can chose custom ids for the models (e.g. semantic ids)
- You can predefine custom settings for the models

However, it is more verbose and you need to specify each model individually.

### Examples

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const myModels = {
  'structuring-model': openai('gpt-4o-2024-08-06', {
    structuredOutputs: true,
  }),
  'smart-model': anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'),
} as const;

const result = await streamText({
  model: myModels['structuring-model'],
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```
