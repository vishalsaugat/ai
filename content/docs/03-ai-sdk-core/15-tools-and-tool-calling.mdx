# Tools and Tool Calling

While large language models have incredible generation capabilities,
they struggle with discrete tasks (eg. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (eg. getting the weather).
Tools can be thought of as programs you give to a model which can be run as and when the model deems applicable.

## Tools

A tool is an object that can be called by the model to perform a specific task.
You can use tools with the `generateText` or `streamText` functions, by passing a tool(s) to the `tools` parameter.

There are three elements of a tool, a description, parameters, and an optional execute function.

- **`description`**: An optional description of the tool that can influence when the tool is picked.
- **`parameters`**: A [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema that defines the parameters. It is converted to a JSON schema that is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **`execute`**: An optional async function that is called with the arguments from the tool call and produces a value of type `RESULT` (generic type). It is optional because you might want to forward tool calls to the client or to a queue instead of executing them in the same process.

The `tools` parameter of `generateText` and `streamText` is an object that has the tool names as keys and the tools as values:

```ts highlight="6-17"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  prompt:
    'What is the weather in San Francisco and what attractions should I visit?',
});
```

<Note>
  You can use the `tool` helper function to infer the types of the `execute`
  parameters.
</Note>

If the LLM decides to use a tool, it will generate a tool call.
Tools with an `execute` function are run automatically when these calls are generated.
The results of the tool executions are returned using tool result objects.
Each tool result object has a `toolCallId`, a `toolName`, a typed `args` object, and a typed `result`.

<Note>
  When a model uses a tool, it is called a "tool call" and the output of the
  tool is called a "tool result".
</Note>

Tool calling is not restricted to only text generation.
You can also use it to [render user interfaces with Generative AI](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/overview#rendering-user-interfaces-with-language-models).

## Tool Choice

You can use the `toolChoice` setting to influence when a tool is selected.
It supports the following settings:

- `auto` (default): the model can choose whether and which tools to call.
- `required`: the model must call a tool. It can choose which tool to call.
- `none`: the model must not call tools
- `{ type: 'tool', toolName: string (typed) }`: the model must call the specified tool

```ts highlight="18"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // force the model to call a tool
  prompt:
    'What is the weather in San Francisco and what attractions should I visit?',
});
```

## Tool Roundtrips

<Note>Tool roundtrips are currently only supported by `generateText`.</Note>

The large language model needs to know the tool results before it can continue generating text.
This requires sending the tool results back to the model.
You can enable this feature by setting the `maxToolRoundtrips` setting to a number greater than 0.

```ts highlight="18"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  maxToolRoundtrips: 5, // allow up to 5 tool roundtrips
  prompt:
    'What is the weather in San Francisco and what attractions should I visit?',
});
```
