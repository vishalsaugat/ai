# AI SDK Core

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced programs that can understand, create, and engage with human language on a large scale.
They are trained on vast amounts of written material to recognize patterns in language and predict what might come next in a given piece of text.

The Vercel AI SDK Core **simplifies working with LLMs by offering a standardized way of integrating them into your app** - so you can focus on building great AI applications for your users, not waste time on technical details.

For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the Vercel AI SDK:

## AI SDK Core Functions

AI SDK Core has various functions designed for [text generation](./generating-text), [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data), and [tool usage](./tools-and-tool-calling).
These functions take a standardized approach to setting up [prompts](./prompts) and [settings](./settings), making it easier to work with different models.

- [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text): Generates text and [tool calls](./tools-and-tool-calling).
  This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.
- [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text): Stream text and tool calls.
  You can use the `streamText` function for interactive use cases such as chat bots and content streaming. You can also generate UI components with tools (see [Generative UI](../ai-sdk-rsc)).

- [`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object): Generates a typed, structured object that matches a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema.
  You can use this function to force the language model to return structured data, e.g. for information extraction, synthetic data generation, or classification tasks.

- [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object): Stream a structured object that matches a Zod schema.
  You can use this function to stream generated UIs in combination with React Server Components (see [Generative UI](../ai-sdk-rsc)).
