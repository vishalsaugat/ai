# Telemetry

The Vercel AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

<Note type="warning">
  This feature is experimental and may change in the future. The following AI
  SDK functions support telemetry: `generateText`, `streamText`,
  `generateObject`, `streamObject`, `embed`, and `embedMany`.
</Note>

## Enabling telemetry

For Next.js applications, please follow the [Next.js OpenTelemetry guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry) to enable telemetry first.

You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on specific function calls while the feature is experimental:

```ts highlight="4"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true },
});
```

When telemetry is enabled, you can also control if you want to record the input values and the output values for the function.
By default, both are enabled. You can disable them by setting the `recordInputs` and `recordOutputs` options to `false`.

Disabling the recording of inputs and outputs can be useful for privacy, data transfer, and performance reasons.
You might for example want to disable recording inputs if they contain sensitive information.

## Telemetry Metadata

You can provide a `functionId` to identify the function that the telemetry data is for,
and `metadata` to include additional information in the telemetry data.

```ts highlight="6-10"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    functionId: 'my-awesome-function',
    metadata: {
      something: 'custom',
      someOtherThing: 'other-value',
    },
  },
});
```
