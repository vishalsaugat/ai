# Generating and Streaming Text

Large language models (LLMs) can generate text in response to a prompt, which can contain instructions and information to process.
For example, you can ask a model to come up with a recipe, draft an email, or summarize a document.

The Vercel AI SDK Core provides two functions to generate text and stream it from LLMs:

- [`generateText`](#generatetext): Generates text for a given prompt and model.
- [`streamText`](#streamtext): Streams text from a given prompt and model.

Advanced LLM features such as [tool calling](./tools-and-tool-calling) and [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data) are built on top of text generation.

## `generateText`

You can generate text using the [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) function. This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

You can use more [advanced prompts](./prompts) to generate text with more complex instructions and content:

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  system:
    'You are a professional writer. You write simple, clear, and concise content.',
  prompt: `summarize the following article in 3-5 sentences:\n${article}`,
});
```

## `streamText`

Depending on your model and prompt, it can take a large language model (LLM) up to a minute to finish generating it's response. This delay can be unacceptable for interactive use cases such as chatbots or real-time applications, where users expect immediate responses.

Vercel AI SDK Core provides the [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function which simplifies streaming text from LLMs.
Its result has methods that can be used in different environments, e.g.
`result.toDataStreamResponse()` to create a response object that can be used
in a Next.js App Router API route.

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = await streamText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});

// example: use textStream as an async iterable
for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  console.log(textPart);
}
```

<Note>
  You can use `streamText` on it's own or in combination with [AI SDK
  UI](/examples/next-pages/basics/streaming-text-generation) and [AI SDK
  RSC](/examples/next-app/basics/streaming-text-generation)
</Note>

`result.textStream` is also a `ReadableStream`, so you can use it in a browser or Node.js environment.

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = await streamText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});

// use textStream as a ReadableStream:
const reader = result.textStream.getReader();
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    break;
  }
  process.stdout.write(value);
}
```

### `onChunk` callback

When using `streamText`, you can provide an `onChunk` callback that is triggered for each chunk of the stream.

It receives the following chunk types:

- `text-delta`
- `tool-call`
- `tool-result`
- `tool-call-streaming-start` (when `experimental_streamToolCalls` is enabled)
- `tool-call-delta` (when `experimental_streamToolCalls` is enabled)

```tsx highlight="6-11"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = await streamText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onChunk({ chunk }) {
    // implement your own logic here, e.g.:
    if (chunk.type === 'text-delta') {
      console.log(chunk.text);
    }
  },
});
```

### `onFinish` callback

When using `streamText`, you can provide an `onFinish` callback that is triggered when the model finishes generating the response and all tool executions.

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = await streamText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onFinish({ text, toolCalls, toolResults, finishReason, usage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage
  },
});
```

### Result helper functions

The result object of `streamText` contains several helper functions to make the integration into [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui) easier:

- `result.toDataStreamResponse()`: Creates a data stream response (with tool calls etc.).
- `result.toTextStreamResponse()`: Creates a simple text stream response.
- `result.pipeDataStreamToResponse()`: Writes AI stream delta output to a Node.js response-like object.
- `result.pipeTextStreamToResponse()`: Writes text delta output to a Node.js response-like object.

### Result promises

The result object of `streamText` contains several promises that resolve when all required data is available:

- `result.text`: The generated text.
- `result.toolCalls`: The tool calls made during text generation.
- `result.toolResults`: The tool results from the tool calls.
- `result.finishReason`: The reason the model finished generating text.
- `result.usage`: The usage of the model during text generation.

## Examples
