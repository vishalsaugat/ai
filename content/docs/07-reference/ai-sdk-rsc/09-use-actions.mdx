# `useActions`

It is a hook to help you access your Server Actions from the client. This is particularly useful for building interfaces that require user interactions with the server.

It is required to access these server actions via this hook because they are patched when passed through the context. Accessing them directly may result in a [Cannot find Client Component error](/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues/server-actions-in-client-components).
